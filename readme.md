Get from A to B

# Features

* Has the ability to transport something/someone (we call the transportee "client") given the source (A) and the destination (B)

* Can exist at source (the transporter - be it a transport service, a tool etc)

* Can pick up the client at source (operation load client) 

* Can release client at destination (operation unload client) 

* The client does not suffer any damage during transport (no canons, please) 

* Can exist at destination 

* Is legal 

* Is invokable (the client or sender of client needs to call in the transporter somehow - e.g. snapping fingers)

# Requirements 

* Define the client! (does it work for cargo alone or is it with live things as well etc)

    * Today I wish to just transport myself, and may be a few family and friends in they fancy a ride.  I leave the door open on where this may go in the future...

* Is it autonomous or does the client need to guide it?

    * It should be as autonomous as it can be - but I would like the ability to manually override if it is doing something stupid.

* Does the client need to be trained to use it?

    * It depends, obviously if this is required to be legal then yes. For phase 1 we’ll say this is the only restriction, but in phase 2 I reserve the right to impose my own pre-conditions on whether training is required.  For example, if my kids are in the car I may require an extra level of certification on top of a standard driving license - apart from if I am driving :)

* Define speed of transport (any requirements around these)

    * Should be legal.

* Define allowed sources

    * Anywhere - let’s start off and say anywhere on earth for Phase 1.

* Define allowed destinations

    * Anywhere - let’s start off and say anywhere on earth for Phase 1.

* Define cost

    * I work in Dubai. Cost is nothing to me.

* Does it need to broadcast its result and to whom and how (I meant - say we talk about a postal service, does it require a receipt confirmation) 

    * That sounds like tech speak to me.  Not sure what you mean.  I would naturally want the ability for it to integrate with other systems if that’s what you mean.

    * Not today - only myself and my family will be travelling.

* Any requirements on the transporter’s durability (magic only works once…) 

    * For phase 1 assume each transporter lasts forever.

* Any requirements around loading time/cost/safety 

    * As I’ve said, I work in Dubai.

* Can it change destination during transport?

* Can it change clients # during transport?
